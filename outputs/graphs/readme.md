# Graphs

This folder contains all visualizations generated by the simulation and analysis
pipeline.

The graphs are created automatically and are used both for direct inspection
and for inclusion in the final PDF reports.

## Types of Visualizations

Depending on the selected dataset and scenario, this folder may contain:

- historical yield trends
- standardized factor trends
- individual factor time series
- factor contribution (importance) charts
- baseline vs scenario comparison plots

## Usage Notes

- Graphs reflect trends and relationships within the selected dataset
- They are intended for interpretation, not exact prediction
- Filenames are generated dynamically based on scenario selection

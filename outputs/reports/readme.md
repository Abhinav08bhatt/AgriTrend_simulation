# Reports

This folder contains automatically generated PDF reports produced by the
AgriTrend_simulation system.

Each report summarizes:
- the selected dataset

- historical trends
- baseline future projections
- scenario comparisons
- conclusions and limitations

## Report Characteristics

- Reports are generated programmatically using the report builder module
- Filenames include dataset and scenario information for clarity
- Content is designed to be scenario-aware and interpretation-safe

## Usage Notes

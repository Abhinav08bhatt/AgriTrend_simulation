# Data Folder

> This folder contains all datasets used in the AgriTrend_simulation project.

The project is designed to work with both synthetic data (used for simulation
and analysis) and real-world data (to be added in future extensions).

The goal of this folder is to clearly separate data from code and make
dataset usage transparent.

# Real-World Data (Placeholder)

This folder is reserved for **real-world agricultural datasets**.

At the current stage of development, the project uses **synthetic data** rather
than official or government-published datasets. This is due to access
constraints and the limited availability of open, machine-readable agricultural
data during the project timeline.

## Why Synthetic Data Is Used

Synthetic data is generated using:
- controlled statistical distributions
- domain-inspired assumptions
- realistic value bounds
- long-term trends and variability

This allows the system to:
- validate the full analysis pipeline
- test model behavior under different conditions
- explore scenario-based outcomes
- demonstrate research methodology in a reproducible way

## Future Integration

The system is intentionally designed so that **real tabular datasets
(CSV or Excel)** can replace synthetic data without requiring any structural
changes to the code.

When real data becomes available, it can be placed in this folder and loaded
using the same data pipeline.

# Synthetic Data

This folder contains synthetically generated agricultural data used for
simulation, analysis, and modeling.

The synthetic dataset is designed to resemble realistic agricultural behavior
while remaining fully controlled and reproducible.

## File
- `universal_synthetic_data.csv`

## Data Format

| year | rainfall_mm | temperature_c | soil_index | irrigation_pct | fertilizer_kg_ha | pest_pressure_index | yield_kg_ha |
|------|-------------|---------------|------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| x    | x           | x             | x          | x              | x                | x                   | x           |

## Notes
- Values are constrained within realistic ranges
- Long-term trends and variability are intentionally included
- Data is suitable for trend analysis and scenario simulation

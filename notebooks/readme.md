# Notebook : Jupyter

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for explanation, exploration and documentation. 

> These notebooks were used to create the base working of this project by me.

These notebooks are meant to help readers understand how the system works, step by step with visual outputs and detailed reasoning.

## Contents
- `documentation_code.ipynb` - Main explanatory notebook for the project
- `sample_notebook/` - Example notebooks using simplified or pseudo data

The notebooks are optional for running the project but useful for learning and validation.

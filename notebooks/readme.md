# Notebook : Jupyter

> These notebooks were used to create the base working of this project by me.

The purpose of keeping them in this repo is to make the code easy to understand...
- These notebooks contains detailed explanation about every single line of code and the real world connection behind it.
- Do go through the notebooks to understand the working and the flow of code behind the files.

The Jupyter files were written in `vs code` with the help of the `jupyter` extension.

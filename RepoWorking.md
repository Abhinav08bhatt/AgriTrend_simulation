# Round 2 

## Objective of the Prototype

The objective of this prototype is to design and demonstrate a **clear, explainable framework**
for analyzing long-term agricultural yield trends and exploring future outcomes under
controlled assumptions.

Rather than optimizing for short-term prediction accuracy, the system prioritizes:

- transparency of assumptions  
- interpretability of results  
- system-level trend understanding  

The project is designed as a **research and exploration tool**, not a forecasting product.

## How Round 2 Builds on Round 1

Round 1 focused on establishing a **clean, interpretable proof of concept**:
a single synthetic dataset, a single intervention scenario, and a complete end-to-end pipeline.

Round 2 extends this foundation by improving **flexibility, structure, and presentation**:

- Multiple selectable synthetic datasets (universal, rice, wheat, maize)  
- Multiple scenario types (best-case improvement, drought stress, fertilizer optimization, climate shift)  
- Dataset-aware and scenario-aware automated PDF reports  
- Cleaner project organization and documentation  
- Safer interpretation language to avoid overclaiming  

The core philosophy remains unchanged:  
**clarity and reasoning over complexity and opacity**.

## System Intent

The prototype is intended to:

- Model relationships between environmental, soil, and management factors and crop yield  
- Demonstrate a complete end-to-end data pipeline  
- Enable scenario-based exploration of future yield trajectories  
- Highlight long-term trends, risks, sensitivities, and trade-offs  
- Serve as a foundation for integrating real-world datasets in later stages  

This system intentionally favors **methodological clarity and structural soundness**
over advanced predictive techniques.

## Data Requirements

The system operates on **tabular agricultural data** stored in CSV or Excel format.

### Required Data Format

| year | rainfall_mm | temperature_c | soil_index | irrigation_pct | fertilizer_kg_ha | pest_pressure_index | yield_kg_ha |
|------|-------------|---------------|------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| x    | x           | x             | x          | x              | x                | x                   | x           |

> In the current prototype, **synthetically generated datasets** following this structure
> are used to ensure reproducibility and controlled experimentation.

## Repository Structure and Responsibilities

### [`data/`](../data)
Stores all datasets used by the system.

- `syntheticData/` — synthetic datasets used in the current prototype  
- `realData/` — reserved for future real-world datasets  

Each subfolder contains its own README describing format and usage.

---

### [`notebooks/`](../notebooks)
Contains Jupyter notebooks used for explanation and documentation.

- `documentation_code.ipynb` — **recommended** notebook explaining the full pipeline,
  including assumptions, code, outputs, and interpretation  
- `sample_notebook/` — simplified example notebooks using pseudo data  

These notebooks are not required to run the system, but they provide the clearest insight
into how and why the system works.

---

### [`outputs/`](../outputs)
Stores all generated outputs from simulation runs.

- `graphs/` — visualizations created during analysis and scenario comparison  
- `reports/` — automatically generated PDF reports  

All contents in this folder are generated programmatically and can be safely deleted
and regenerated by re-running the main script.

---

### [`src/`](../src)
Contains all core source code, organized in a modular and readable structure.

- `data_generation.py` — generic synthetic data generation  
- `crop_data_generation.py` — crop-specific synthetic data generation  
- `data_loader.py` — dataset saving and loading  
- `analysis.py` — regression and factor contribution analysis  
- `model.py` — model training and baseline future projection  
- `scenarios.py` — intervention and stress scenario definitions  
- `visualization.py` — graph generation and saving  
- `report_builder.py` — automated PDF report construction  
- `paths.py` — centralized path management  

---

### [`AgriTrend_simulation.py`](../AgriTrend_simulation.py)
The main execution file.

Running this file executes the full pipeline:
1. data selection
2. data generation / loading
3. analysis
4. visualization
5. scenario simulation
6. PDF report generation

---

### [`requirements.txt`](../requirements.txt)
Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Important Notes

- The system does **not** aim to predict real-world yields  
- Results are **illustrative**, not prescriptive  
- Outcomes depend on dataset assumptions and scenario design  
- The framework is intended for exploration, learning, and comparison  

> Design decisions in both Round 1 and Round 2 emphasize  
> **clarity, honesty, and interpretability over complexity**.
